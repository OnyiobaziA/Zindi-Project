African Credit Scoring Challenge; Financial institutions need to predict loan defaults to mitigate risk and optimise lending decisions. 

In Africaâ€™s rapidly growing financial markets, with diverse customer demographics and dynamic economic conditions, accurately assessing default risk is more important than ever.
In the challenge, we develop a robust, generalizable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults for both existing customers and new applicants. Beyond accurate predictions, we encourage you to innovate by incorporating unique factors relevant to each financial market.

The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine-learning model that accurately predicts the probability of loan default.
